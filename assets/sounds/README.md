# Sound Assets for Picture Sudoku

This folder contains the sound effects used in the Picture Sudoku game.

## Win Sound

The `win.mp3` file is played when you successfully complete the puzzle.

To customize the win sound:

1. Replace the existing `win.mp3` file with your own
2. Make sure your file is named `win.mp3`
3. MP3 format is recommended for best browser compatibility

You can use any sound you prefer for the win celebration - something jubilant and celebratory works best!
