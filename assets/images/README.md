# Image Assets for Picture Sudoku

This folder contains the images used in the Picture Sudoku game.

## Default Images

The default images (`image1.png` through `image10.png`) are simple colored circles with numbers.

## Custom Images

To use your own images:

1. Place your PNG images in the `custom` folder
2. Name them numerically, starting from 1 (e.g., `1.png`, `2.png`, etc.)
3. Make sure you have enough images to match your grid size (e.g., 9 images for a 9x9 grid)
4. Your images should be square for best results
5. The game will automatically use your custom images if they are available

## Trash Icon

The `trash.png` image is used for the trash can where you can drop images to remove them from the grid.

## Placeholder Image

The `placeholder.png` image is used as a fallback if other images can't be loaded.
